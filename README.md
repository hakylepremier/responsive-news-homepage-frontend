## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM(CSS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to style images properly using object-fit.

A few code snippet examples:

```css
.card__img {
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	object-fit: cover;
}
```

### Continued development

In future I hope to use gid in more projects.

### Useful resources

- [A video on object fit by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yAAV-uP0po&t=147s&pp=ygUOb2JqZWN0IGZpdCBjc3M%3D) - This helped me truly understand how to properly use object fit in my project.
- [Css Grid video by Slaying The Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiNiSFIPIQE&t=337s&pp=ygUIY3NzIGdyaWQ%3D) - This helped me gain a better understanding of Css grid without having to watch hours of videos.
